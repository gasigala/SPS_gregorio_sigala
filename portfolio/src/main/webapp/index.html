      <h1>Gregorio Sigala's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <p>My name is Gregorio Sigala, I currently attend The University of Texas at El Paso. My intrest's include:  
          playing tennis, listening to music, and coding of course. Ever since I was a child I have a been a 
          huge advocate for offloading work onto someone else. Computer science provides all the ability to tell
          an entity what to do without the guilt. Through computers we can make our lives substancially easier, and I 
          hope to accomplish this with the work I do now and in the future. 
      </p>
      <p>Software product sprint is the first major project that I've worked on however, you can find me on
           <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregorio-sigala-6305a81a0/">linkedin</a> 
          and <a href="https://github.com/gasigala/">github</a>.
           Recently I've become very intrested in the human computer interaction aspect of computer science
          and the psychology behind it. Usually when a new feature is introduced to a prodcut the responce is very binary
          either "I love it" or "this just ruined the app for me." Regardless if the feature is usefull or not, if it 
          doesn't feel nice then no one is going to use it.
